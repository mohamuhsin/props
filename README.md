## Props

When thinking in the context of a React application, components are small pieces of a whole. Together, they make up the interface that users will see.

With each component playing a role in the interface, there are times when components must be able to communicate with other components.

In this lesson, you will learn another way that components can interact: a component passing information to another component.

Information that gets passed from one component to another is known as `props`.

Props can be used to customize the output of each component depending on the information that is passed in.

By allowing components to communicate with each other, we can add a level of flexibility that was not possible before.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Pass, access, and display props.
- Use props to create conditional statements.
- Define event handlers in a component and pass them to other components.
- Work with a component's children.
- Assign default values to props.

Let's get started!
